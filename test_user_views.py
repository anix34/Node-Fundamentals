# For the routing and view function tests
# Make sure that requests to all the endpoints supported in the views files return valid responses. 
# Start by testing that the response code is what you expect, 
# then do some light HTML testing to make sure the response is what you expect.

# TODO: Test authentication and authorization. 
# Here are some examples of questions your view function tests should answer regarding these ideas:

# When you’re logged in, can you see the follower / following pages for any user?
# When you’re logged out, are you disallowed from visiting a user’s follower / following pages?
# When you’re logged in, can you add a message as yourself?
# When you’re logged in, can you delete a message as yourself?
# When you’re logged out, are you prohibited from adding messages?
# When you’re logged out, are you prohibited from deleting messages?
# When you’re logged in, are you prohibiting from adding a message as another user?
# When you’re logged in, are you prohibiting from deleting a message as another user?
